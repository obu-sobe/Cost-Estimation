# Cost_Estimation
Progress monitoring has many applications in the construction industry. This includes cost estimation of build cost, or estimation of the cost of certain tasks, i.e. maintenance such as painting a wall. As part of automation in BIM, we are developing a novel method for combining computer vision, machine learning and image processing techniques for cost estimation in construction site. The problem is proven to be challenging and requires a large number of images taken containing items under consideration such as concrete / bricks walls, beams, glass partitions / fronts. Roofs, etc. The required images can be random, not necessarily focused on a specific item. For example, a good image may include multiple items, i.e. a picture of a wall with a door and a window, wall sockets, etc.,  which can be taken from different angles and over the period of the building project. Another way to obtain a large number of images is by using a (mobile) camera and record shorts videos. In this way, the short videos can be processed to produce a large number of (frames) images.
